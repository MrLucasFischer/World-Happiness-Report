# World Happiness Report

This is a study of the [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). This study aims to answer three relevant questions: 

* Did the values in the rank significantly changed in the three measured years?

* What variables contribute the most to the happiness rank and can we summarize the data set?

* How did the different continents differ from each other?

A report written in portuguese can be found with this repo.
